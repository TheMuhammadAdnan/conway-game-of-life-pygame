# Conway's Game of Life

This is an implementation of Conway's Game of Life using Python and Pygame. Conway's Game of Life is a cellular automaton devised by British mathematician John Horton Conway. The game consists of a grid of cells, where each cell can be in one of two states: alive (1) or dead (0). The next state of the grid is determined by applying a set of simple rules to the current state.

## Features

- Random initial grid configuration
- Cells can be toggled between alive and dead states by clicking on them
- Game window can be closed by clicking the "X" button

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Pygame

## Installation

1. Install Python 3.x from the official website: https://www.python.org/downloads/
2. Install Pygame using pip:

```
pip install pygame
```

3. Clone or download this repository.

## Usage

1. Navigate to the folder containing the game files.
2. Run the game using the following command:
```
python game_of_life.py
```

3. Enjoy the Game of Life!
